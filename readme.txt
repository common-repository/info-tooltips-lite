<h4>How to use it</h4>

So all is pretty simple:
After plugin activated there will be "Tooltip" menu. There you can add any number of tooltips with any content you like (standard TinyMCE editor can be used for this purpose).
On tooltip editor page there is "Word to apply" meta box. There you can set all tooltip settings:
<ul>
	<li><strong>"Word (phrase) to apply"</strong> - here you can enter word or phrase. Tooltip will be added to this word on front page view</li>
	<li><strong>"Block Width"</strong> - here you can set width of tooltip. Can be useful depending on style you want to get</li>
	<li><strong>"Style"</strong> - here you can set style of tooltip. In general - it is color selector. ( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Use Tooltip Shadow"</strong> - here you can set to use tooltip shadow or not.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Show On"</strong> - action to show tooltip: word hover or word click.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Additional Word Styling"</strong> - here you can set CSS styling to word with tooltip added.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Additional Word Hover Styling"</strong> - here you can set CSS styling to word with tooltip added when user hover it.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Block Position"</strong> - here you can set where tooltip will appear relatively to word.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Use Rounded Corners"</strong> - here you can set to use rounded corners or not.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Show Tooltip Title"</strong> - here you can set to show tooltip title ( post title ) on top of tooltip or not.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
	<li><strong>"Show Title Close Button"</strong> - here you can set to show tooltip close button on top of tooltip or not.( available in Pro Version  )</li>
</ul>

So for example we can use "wordpress" as word to replace.

Now we can go to single post editor and there you will find "Use Tooltip" meta box.
Settings:
<ul>
	<li><strong>"Use Replacement in this post"</strong> - here you can set turn on or off replacement function in this post.</li>
	<li><strong>"Select tooltips you want to use in this post"</strong> - here you can select one or more tooltips to apply to current post</li>
</ul>
	
So after choosing tooltip "Wordpress" and saving post in single post editor - tooltips will be added to all occurrences of word "Wordpress"	on frontend view.

Also you can use TinyMCE selector to select single word and add tooltip shortcode only to this word(phrase). So e.g. you can turn off Replacement option and use tooltip shortcoder addition. Pretty flexible ( available in Delux Version  )

Also there is "Tooltips -> Settings" page. Here you can turn on or off places, where replacement will happens. Single Post only is turned on for default.
